<h3>Hi! I'm Jorge Montes ðŸ‘‹</h3>

<div align="left">

I'm a **DevOps-driven software developer** who loves building reliable infrastructure and simplifying systems through automation.  
I value **speed and clarity** â€” not just to move fast, but to help teams focus on what really matters.

Currently, Iâ€™m open to **new opportunities** where I can contribute with my passion for **Golang, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD pipelines**, and modern DevOps culture.
